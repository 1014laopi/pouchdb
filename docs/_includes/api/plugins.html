Writing a plugin is easy! The API is:

{% highlight js %}
PouchDB.plugin({
  methodName: myFunction
});
{% endhighlight %}

This will add the function as a method of all databases with the given method name.  It will always be called in context, so that `this` always refers to the database object.

We also offer a [PouchDB Plugin Seed project](https://github.com/pouchdb/plugin-seed), which is the fastest way to get started writing, building and testing your very own plugin.

#### Example Usage:
{% highlight js %}
PouchDB.plugin({
  sayMyName : function () {
    this.info().then(function (info)   {
      console.log('My name is ' + info.db_name);
    }).catch(function (err) { });
  }
});
new PouchDB('foobar').sayMyName(); // prints "My name is foobar"
{% endhighlight %}
