[PouchDB 3.0.0](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/releases/tag/3.0.0) is finally released! Please [file issues](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues) or [tell us what you think](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#get-in-touch). We would also like to give a huge thanks to our [new and existing contributors](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/graphs/contributors?from=2014-06-01&to=2014-08-12).

### Breaking Changes:
* `opts.server` has been deprecated from the `replicate()` and `sync()` APIs. You can still replicate from one HTTP server to another, but the data will flow through PouchDB rather than being server-initiated. ([#2313](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2313)).
* You can no longer rely on errors to have an identifying name instead rely on couchdb centric errors to have a status.  There are some that still have an identifying name, THESE COULD BE REMOVED AT ANY TIME. The upside of this is that stack traces should be more consistently helpful. ([#2545](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2545))

### Major Changes:

 *  Local documents are now unversioned for better map/reduce performance and to better align the update_seq with CouchDB ([#2023](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2023)), also fixes an issue with replication and `changes()` ([#2342](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2342))
  * Constructor option opts.size to work around Safari/iOS storage quotas (#2347)
PouchDB.defaults() for default constructor options, permits many new features in pouchdb-server ([#2054](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2054))
 * Performance improvements ([#2391](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2391), [#2392](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2392), [#2393](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2393))
 * MD5 hashes are now calculated incrementally in a way that won't freeze the DOM ([#445](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/445))
 * More efficient replication ([#2466](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2466), [#2475](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2475))


### Bugfixes:

 * Fix for bulkDocs() in Cloudant ([#2365](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2365))
 * Fix readOnly replication for CORS/40* ([#2484](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2484))
 * Fix for reserved words in docs ([#2477](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2477))
 * Fixes for attachments in Chrome and IE ([#2497](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2497))
 * Fixes for `change` events in `.sync()` ([#2555](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2555))
 * Fixes for race condition in bulk docs with `new_edits=false` in leveldb ([#2574](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2574))
 * Fix errors related to the size parameter in Android websql ([#2581](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/2581))
